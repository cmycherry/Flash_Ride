<h1>List of Tasks for First Scrum</h1>
<h3>Charging function</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research how rechargeable batteries work and whether we can make a USB
    charger built in so we don&rsquo;t have to remove the batteries</li>
<li>Acquire batteries</li>
<li>Acquire female mini-USB connector</li>
<li>Assemble charging circuit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Brake light switch and cable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research what kind of switch to use to actuate light<ul>
<li>Easy to press with a finger</li>
<li>Goes on when pressed, off when released</li>
<li>(Possibly) has several settings (for future versions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acquire switch</li>
<li>Research what kind of cable we need to connect switch to helmet<ul>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Durable</li>
<li>Protected from short-circuits (no exposed wires)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine length of cable needed for a typical situation</li>
<li>Acquire cable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Brake light (first prototype: off-the-shelf solution from Planet Bike)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Figure out how the light works</li>
<li>Figure out how to incorporate recharging into the circuit (see Charging
    above)</li>
<li>Find out how to make the handlebar switch work with the circuit inside the
    light (the current switch is a button-toggle with 3 settings: off, solid on,
    and flash)</li>
<li>Acquire any electronic components needed</li>
<li>Assemble the circuit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Location tracker app</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a wireframe illustrating basic functionality</li>
</ul>
<h3>Handlebar attachment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Determine 3 methods for attaching switch to handlebars<ul>
<li>Weatherproof</li>
<li>Easy to remove</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decide which method is best for first prototype (possibly with input from
    users)</li>
<li>Acquire or create handlebars for testing</li>
<li>Implement that method</li>
</ul>
<h3>Helmet attachment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Determine 3 methods for attaching light to helmet</li>
<li>Decide which method is best for first prototype (possibly with input from
    users)</li>
<li>Acquire or create a helmet for testing</li>
<li>Implement that method</li>
</ul>
