# List of Tasks for First Scrum #

### Charging function ###

  - Research how rechargeable batteries work and whether we can make a USB
    charger built in so we don't have to remove the batteries
  - Acquire batteries
  - Acquire female mini-USB connector
  - Assemble charging circuit

### Brake light switch and cable ###

  - Research what kind of switch to use to actuate light
      * Easy to press with a finger
      * Goes on when pressed, off when released
      * (Possibly) has several settings (for future versions)
  - Acquire switch
  - Research what kind of cable we need to connect switch to helmet
      * Flexible
      * Durable
      * Protected from short-circuits (no exposed wires)
  - Determine length of cable needed for a typical situation
  - Acquire cable

### Brake light (first prototype: off-the-shelf solution from Planet Bike) ###

  - Figure out how the light works
  - Figure out how to incorporate recharging into the circuit (see Charging
    above)
  - Find out how to make the handlebar switch work with the circuit inside the
    light (the current switch is a button-toggle with 3 settings: off, solid on,
    and flash)
  - Acquire any electronic components needed
  - Assemble the circuit

### Location tracker app ###

  - Make a wireframe illustrating basic functionality

### Handlebar attachment ###

  - Determine 3 methods for attaching switch to handlebars
      * Weatherproof
      * Easy to remove
  - Decide which method is best for first prototype (possibly with input from
    users)
  - Acquire or create handlebars for testing
  - Implement that method

### Helmet attachment ###

  - Determine 3 methods for attaching light to helmet
  - Decide which method is best for first prototype (possibly with input from
    users)
  - Acquire or create a helmet for testing
  - Implement that method
